      <h1>RAM</h1>
      <h2>Random Access Memory</h2>
      <p>RAM is a super-fast type of memory that stores the apps you've opened since you turned on your phone. That
        memory lets you return to an app you've previously used and pick up right where you left off, without delay. Here’s a quick overview of our RAM recommendations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          <strong>Less than 4GB ram</strong> is not recommended for anyone but should suffice for basic purpose.
          </li>
          <li><strong>4GB of RAM</strong> is recommended as a minimum configuration for the typical productivity user.</li>
          <li><strong>6GB RAM</strong> means that the more there is in your phone, it’ll be able to handle more apps and the data in the
            background—this will enable much faster switching between apps, and the ability to open and leave more
            pieces of software running.</li>
          <li><strong>8GB RAM(or more)</strong> phone might be ‘future-proof’, but most of us will change our phones anyways. It might make sense
            to feel that buying an 8GB RAM smartphone will make the phone last longer as you would be able to
            future-proof yourself when heavier games or apps are launched. </li>

      <h1>Processor</h1>
      <h2>CPU Chip</h2>
      <p>The processor is the central hub of your smartphone. It receives and executes every command, performing
        billions of calculations per second. The effectiveness of the processor directly affects every application you
        run, whether it's the camera, the music player, or just a simple email program. Pick the wrong one and you could
        experience sluggish, stuttering apps and limited network performance, regardless of carrier, manufacturer, or
        operating system.
        The ability of the processor to coordinate efficient communication between all its components—the modem,
        graphics, and multimedia engines—is essential to smooth operation.

      <h1>ROM</h1>
      <h2>Read-only-Memory (Storage)</h2>
      <p> ROM (Read Only Memory) is a form of data storage. This type of memory keeps the saved data even if the device
        power is off. The word Read-only identifies it as "read-only memory", since the reprogramming process is
        generally infrequent, comparatively slow, and often does not permit random access writes to individual memory
        locations. It equals a hard disk in a computer, storing various of files, including videos, songs, photos, and
        system software, etc. At present, most smartphones are equipped with 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, or even 128GB, 256GB
        large ROM. But we have to pay attention that in phones the ROM is not described with ROM but with storage.

      <h1>Display</h1>
      <h2>All about resolution and touch response</h2>
      <p>The technology used in mobile displays in the modern day smartphones has progressed significantly. In the era
        of touchscreen smartphones, the display technology has become one of its primary selling points, and certainly
        its most unique feature
        There are many display/panel types used in smartphones today.
        <p>Which one is Suitable for you ?</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>IPS LCD technology</strong> offers better display quality as compared to the TFT-LCD display. The good part about IPS LCD is that it offers better viewing angles and consumes less power.</li>
        <li><strong>Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display</strong> technology is much better as compared to the LCD display technology because of its excellent colour reproduction, faster response times, wider viewing angles, higher brightness and extremely light weight designs.
          OLEDs are brighter than LEDs and do not require backlighting like LCDs. Since OLEDs do not require backlighting, they consume much less power than LCDs.</li>
        <li><strong>AMOLED</strong> screens can control each pixel individuality while maintaining the properties of an OLED panel.
          AMOLED screens have all the attributes of an OLED display like excellent colour reproduction, faster response times, wider viewing angles, higher brightness and extremely light weight designs.
          This is the preferred technology of smartphone manufacturers although they are quite expensive to produce.          
          Opt for AMOLED display over TFT LCD.</li>
        <li><strong>Super AMOLED display technology</strong> is an advanced version of AMOLED display. Samsung uses this term for the AMOLED panels that they develop. Super AMOLED  screens are built with capacitive touch sensors on the display itself. Super AMOLED display is much more responsive than an AMOLED display.</li>
      </ul>

          <p>OnePlus is a Shenzhen-based start-up and producer of smartphones founded in December, 2013 - a subsidiary
            of BBK Electronics. The company's claim to fame is its bid to offer flagship-level specs in its smartphones,
            at affordable prices. Outside of phones, OnePlus also has a limited range of other products. Its first
            non-smartphone product — aside from cases, chargers, and other accessories — was a set of wired headphones
            known as OnePlus Bullets.

          <h1>Xiaomi</h1>
          <p>Xiaomi has been one of the fastest growing smartphone manufacturers in India over the past 18 months,
            becoming the biggest smartphone brand in the process. It managed to capture a large chunk of the market with
            its Redmi series by offering powerful hardware at affordable prices. While the lower end of the market
            welcomed Xiaomi smartphones, the higher end still preferred established brands such as Samsung and OnePlus.
            Premium Xiaomi phones haven't done well in India, and the Chinese manufacturer hasn't launched a flagship
            phone in the country since the Mi 5 (Review).

          <p>Xiaomi says that the new Poco sub-brand lets it start with a clean slate, without being burdened by the
            expectations that people have based on its other products.
            POCO understands the core elements of a great smartphone experience and focuses on providing exactly that.
            We think this is what users want, instead of abundant features that aren’t crucial and in fact add to costs.
            So POCO delivers a fluid, speedy and flagship experience at an irresistible price tag. Our devices offer the
            ultimate performance with no frills.

        <summary class="faq__summary"><span class="faq__question">Does Having a Better CPU Always Translate Into Better
            Performance?</span></summary>
        <p class="faq__text">Performance on mobile devices does not entirely depend on the CPU. While the CPU serves a
          very high purpose on the device, it still has to wait for other hardware to respond. If your RAM or storage is
          cheaply-made and doesn’t have what it takes to catch up to the CPU, you’re in for a nasty surprise. On phone
          and tablet specification sheets, you’ll rarely see how fast the other hardware is. They always use the CPU as
          a selling point, which is at the very least a bit of an annoyance for those who would like to see exactly what
          it is that they’re buying.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq__detail">
        <summary class="faq__summary"><span class="faq__question">How Much RAM Does My Smartphone Really Need?</span>
        </summary>
        <p class="faq__text">Adding more RAM is an easy way for a manufacturer to make a device look better. A bigger
          number must mean it's better, right? While that's generally true, finding the right amount of RAM poses a
          unique problem in the smartphone world. How much is "enough"? The short answer is that you should look for a
          baseline of at least 4GB for a phone. The long answer is a bit more complicated.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq__detail">
        <summary class="faq__summary"><span class="faq__question">Do Massive Megapixel Counts Matter With Smartphone
            Cameras?</span></summary>
        <p class="faq__text">So common sense would suggest that more megapixels should be good, right? You get bigger
          pictures and logically, more detail.

          Well, not quite. The truth is that a megapixel is more a measure of size, not of quality. The only thing more
          megapixels can truly guarantee you is the ability to get a much larger picture. So yes, if you are looking to
          print billboard-sized images, then perhaps a higher megapixel count will make a difference.

          But just how good a picture will be in terms of quality (colour, depth, detail, contrast, dynamic range and so
          much more) depends on the quality of the camera’s other parts—the sensor that is fitted inside the camera, the
          lenses, the size of the aperture, the software processing and so on
        </p>

      <details class="faq__detail">
        <summary class="faq__summary"><span class="faq__question">
            Does fast charging affect battery life?</span></summary>
        <p class="faq__text">Unless there's some technical flaw with your battery or charger electronics, however, using
          a fast charger won't do your phone's battery any long-term damage.

          Here's why. Fast-charging batteries work in two phases. The first phase applies a blast of voltage to the
          empty or nearly empty battery. This gives you that blazing charge of from 50% to 70% in the first 10, 15 or 30
          minutes. That's because during the first phase of charging, batteries can absorb a charge quickly without
          major negative effects on their long-term health.

          For instance, Samsung promises its 45-watt charger can go from zero to a 70% charge in half an hour. Apple
          says the fast charger that comes with its iPhone 11 Pro can hit a 50% charge in 30 minutes.</p>
